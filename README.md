## Problem 1: Multiplication for Kids

multiplication questions to do. After each, the program should tell them
whether they got it right or wrong and what the correct answer is.

Example:

```
Question 1: 3 x 4 = 12
Right!

Question 2: 8 x 6 = 44
Wrong! The right answer is 48

...

```

(b) Save the program to GitHub
